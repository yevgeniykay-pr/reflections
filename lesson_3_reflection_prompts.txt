When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  So your local changes are not overwritten by someones updates to the files your're working on.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    clone - copy of another repository where parent does not know/keeps track of cloning party
    fork - copy of another repository where parent repository aware of the fact that it was copied AS WELL AS forked repository has link to original
    branch - local copy related (by git log) to originating parent
