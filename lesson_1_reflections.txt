How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

Made it really easy.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Ability to create and store history of dev. changes allow you easily get back
to version of the code that may have been usefull.
But more importantly to get back to working version of the code if recent changes broke it.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Pros:
Developer is the one knowing when to save code - as phase of development or functionality gets implemented.

Cons:
Sometimes machines(PCs) fail (and changes get lost as not saved/stored in version control) 
Or developer lazy to save/store in version control.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log - show all commits
git diff id1 id2 to compare
git config --global color.ui auto ( to set color in diff - does not work in cygwin????)

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
